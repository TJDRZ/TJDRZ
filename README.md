### Hi there I'm TJDRZðŸ‘‹

## I'm a self-taught Web Developer and have an Associate's degree in Computer Networking Technology

(Lots of repos on my account are named via projects from The Odin Project. Others may be a mix of personal / collaborations / professional work.)

I'm currently working on utilizing Front-end/Full-Stack Development languages/frameworks/tools:  
-JavaScript  
-HTML  
-CSS  
-ReactJS  
-Webpack  
-ESLint  
-Prettier  
-Jest  
and am hoping to continue to Back-end and databases using NodeJS/Express/MongoDB afterwards.



*I also am a fluent guitarist interested in music theory and improvisation. Feel free to ask me about it!*
