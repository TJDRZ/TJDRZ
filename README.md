### Hi there I'm TJDRZðŸ‘‹

## I'm a self-taught Web Developer and have an Associate's degree in Computer Networking Technology

(Lots of repos on my account are named via projects from The Odin Project. Other's may be a mix of personal / collaborations / professional work.)

I'm currently working on a stack of Front-end Development languages/frameworks/tools and hoping to continue to Back-end and databases using NodeJS/Express/MongoDB afterwards.

*I also am a fluent guitarist interested in music theory and improvisation. Feel free to ask me about it!*
